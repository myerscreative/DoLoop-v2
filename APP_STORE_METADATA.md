### Full Description (4000 chars max)

```
Doloop is a looping to-do list app designed for habits, routines, and recurring tasks that you do over and over again.

Unlike traditional one-time checklists, Doloop lets you create reusable task loops that reset automatically or on-demand. Perfect for:

• Daily morning/evening routines
• Weekly meal prep checklists
• Travel packing lists
• Team workflows and SOPs
• Household chores
• Gym routines
• Project templates

HOW IT WORKS

1. CREATE A LOOP
Build your checklist once - morning routine, camping trip, onboarding process, etc.

2. CHECK OFF TASKS
Complete tasks as you go. Watch the beautiful progress ring fill up as you make progress.

3. TAP RELOOP
When you're done, tap "Reloop" to reset all tasks and start fresh. Your loop is ready for tomorrow, next week, or your next adventure.

KEY FEATURES

🔄 Reusable Loops
Create checklists you can use again and again. Never rebuild the same list twice.

📊 Progress Rings
Beautiful visual feedback shows your completion status at a glance.

⏰ Auto-Reset
Set loops to reset daily or weekly automatically. Your morning routine is ready every day.

🔥 Streak Counter
Build consistency with streak tracking. See how many consecutive days you've completed all your daily loops.

📁 Smart Organization
Organize loops by type: Personal, Work, Daily, or Shared.

👥 Shared Loops (Coming Soon)

🌙 Dark Mode
Easy on the eyes with automatic dark mode support.

💾 Offline First
Works perfectly without internet. Syncs when you're back online.

⚡ One-Time Tasks

PERFECT FOR

📅 Daily Habits
Morning routine, evening routine, daily standup checklist

WHY DOLOOP?

Most to-do apps are designed for one-time tasks. But many things we do are repetitive - morning routines, weekly reviews, travel prep. Doloop is built specifically for these recurring workflows.

Instead of checking off tasks and losing them forever, your loops stick around. Instead of creating the same list over and over, you build it once and reuse it endlessly.
