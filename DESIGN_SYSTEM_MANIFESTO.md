# DoLoop Design System Manifesto – "The Second Self"

This document outlines the core philosophy and design rules for DoLoop. Every component and interaction must adhere to these principles to create a calm, organized, and premium experience.

## 1. The "Second Self" UI/UX Framework

### A. The "Three-Tap" Rule

No core action should ever take more than three taps.

1. **Tap 1: Intent** (e.g., Library)
2. **Tap 2: Selection** (e.g., Hormozi Loop)
3. **Tap 3: Activation** (e.g., Start Loop)

### B. Spatial Consistency (The "Mental Map")

The brain hates it when things move unexpectedly.

- **The "Now" Zone:** The center of the screen is always the current task.
- **The "History" Zone:** Swiping down shows what you’ve finished (The Past).
- **The "Future" Zone:** Swiping up shows what’s coming (The Horizon).

### C. Sensory Feedback (Kinetic Design)

To make the digital space feel physical and real:

- **Checking Tasks:** Subtle haptic feedback combined with a "Gold Pulse" from the progress ring.
- **Info-Drop:** Should slide out like a drawer, not just appear.

## 2. The "Clean Canvas" Layout

Avoid the "Busy Dashboard" trap. When a loop is active, everything else should fade.

- **Minimalist Headers:** Only the Loop Title and the Momentum Ring.
- **Focus Mode:**
  - Active step: 100% white text (Visual Anchor).
  - Other steps: 40% grey (Dims the lights on the future).
- **The "Ketchup" Slot:** A persistent, faint "+" button between steps for "Think and Add" without leaving the flow.

## 3. High-Level Architecture Instructions

### Visual Language: "Premium Vibrant"

- **Primary Action Color:** Gold (#FEC00F).
- **Background:** Deep, dark charcoal (near black).
- **Surfaces:** Glassmorphism for overlays.
- **Typography:** High-contrast Inter or Outfit.

### Narrative Structure

- **The "Why":** Every Loop must have an "Info-Drop" explaining the context.
- **The "Who":** Every Loop must have "Provenance" (the expert behind it).
- **Affiliate Path:** Conclude with a "Success Footer" (Creator Bio, CTA for deeper training, affiliate-ready link).

### Cognitive Engineering: "Focus & Fade"

- **Task Visualization:** The active task is the visual anchor. Completed tasks are visually "shelved" (minimized) to reduce clutter.
- **Frictionless Entry:** "Rapid Entry" logic (Type -> Enter -> Type) in all editors.

## 4. The Aesthetic: "Calm & Expensive"

Imagine the screen is a deep, dark charcoal. The Momentum Ring is a thin, glowing thread of Gold. When you tap a step, the text glows and softly settles into a "done" state. Author photos look like premium magazine covers with soft depth.

**It is "Second Self": Calm, organized, and expensive-feeling.**
